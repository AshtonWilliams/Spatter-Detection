# Spatter-Detection
C++ program that utilizes the OpenCV library to detect spatter and dark spots in 3D printed layer images I made as a junior in college.

The program detects spatter and dark spots on layer images and extracts data about them

Below is a comparison image showing the before and after of how it works for spatter:
